# Open Source APIs

Welcome to this session on Open Source APIs!  To get started, you'll need the following things:

* A Census API Key - register for one [here.](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
* A Geoclient API Key - register for one [here.](https://api-portal.nyc.gov/signup)
* Create a .env file for your environment variables and save it on your drive (more details on that in the presentation).
* Open the Colab notebook if you want to run the script alongside me!
